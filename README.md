# tev â€” The EXR Viewer

![](https://github.com/tom94/tev/workflows/CI/badge.svg)


## New features
-  Add the support of Numpy array. (np.float16/float32 as HDR image, np.uint8 as LDR image)
- [todo] image computation (add, multiply, etc.)
- [todo] display channels of image
- [todo] image resize
- [todo] other Error metric (SSIM, PSNR, LPips, etc.)

-------------------------------------

A high dynamic range (HDR) image comparison tool for graphics people. __tev__ allows viewing images through various tonemapping operators and inspecting the values of individual pixels. Often, it is important to find exact differences between pairs of images. For this purpose, __tev__ allows rapidly switching between opened images and visualizing various error metrics (L1, L2, and relative versions thereof). To avoid clutter, opened images and their layers can be filtered by keywords.

While the predominantly supported file format is OpenEXR certain other types of images can also be loaded. The following file formats are currently supported:
- __EXR__ (via [OpenEXR](https://github.com/wjakob/openexr))
- __PFM__ (compatible with [Netbpm](http://www.pauldebevec.com/Research/HDR/PFM/))
- __HDR__, BMP, GIF, JPEG, PIC, PNG, PNM, PSD, TGA (via [stb_image](https://github.com/wjakob/nanovg/blob/master/src/stb_image.h))
    - stb_image only supports [subsets](https://github.com/wjakob/nanovg/blob/master/src/stb_image.h#L23) of each of the aforementioned file formats.
    - Low-dynamic-range (LDR) images are "promoted" to HDR through the reverse sRGB transformation.

## Usage

### Graphical User Interface

Images can be opened via a file dialog or simply by dragging them into __tev__. They can be reloaded, closed, or filtered at any time, so don't worry about opening more images than exactly needed.

Select an image by left-clicking it, and optionally select a reference image to compare the current selection to by right-clicking. For convenience, the current selection can be moved with the Up/Down or the 1-9 keys. For a comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts simply click the little "?" icon at the top (or press "h").

If the interface seems overwhelming, simply hover any controls to view an explanatory tooltip.

### Command Line

Simply supply images as positional command-line arguments.
```sh
$ tev foo.exr bar.exr
```

By default, all layers and channels are loaded, but individual layers or channels can also be specified. In the following example, the *depth* layer of *foo.exr* and the *r*, *g*, and *b* channels of *foo.exr* and *bar.exr* are loaded.
```sh
$ tev :depth foo.exr :r,g,b foo.exr bar.exr
```

Other command-line arguments also exist (e.g. for starting __tev__ with a pre-set exposure value). For a list of all valid arguments simply invoke
```sh
$ tev -h
```

## Obtaining tev

### macOS / Windows

Pre-built binaries for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and macOS (64-bit) are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/Tom94/tev/releases).

### Linux

- Archlinux: available on the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tev/)

## Building tev

All that is required for building __tev__ is a C++11-compatible compiler. Begin by cloning this repository and all its submodules using the following command:
```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Tom94/tev
```

If you accidentally omitted the `--recursive` flag when cloning this repository you can initialize the submodules like so:
```sh
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

__tev__ uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as its build system. The following sections detail how it should be used on various operating systems.

### macOS / Linux

On macOS and most Linux distributions [CMake](https://cmake.org/) can be obtained via a package manager ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS, apt on Ubuntu/Debian, etc.). Most Linux distributions additionally require _xorg_, _gl_, and _zlib_ development packages and _zenity_. On Ubuntu/Debian simply call
```sh
$ apt-get install cmake xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev zenity
```

Once all dependencies are installed, create a new directory to contain build artifacts, enter it, and then invoke [CMake](https://cmake.org/) with the root __tev__ folder as argument as shown in the following example:
```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```

Afterwards, __tev__ can be built and installed via
```sh
$ make -j
$ make install
```

### Windows

On Windows, install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/), open the included GUI application, and point it to the root directory of __tev__. CMake will then generate [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) project files for compiling __tev__. Make sure you select at least Visual Studio 2017 or higher!

## License

__tev__ is available under the BSD 3-clause license, which you can find in the `LICENSE.md` file. [TL;DR](https://tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-3-clause-license-(revised)) you can do almost whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software and the source code.
